ISSUES
in wifi : picow_tcp_server, wifi is still hardcoded, unable to find out why i cant use WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD
	printf returns <YOUR SSID> <YOUR PASSWORD>, printing in the lab ping file i was able to get the values

WARNINGS
CYW43_LWIP redefined in wheel_encoder.c, motor_controller.c not sure why only those 2 
files as well, as there should be multiple files calling for the same LWIP file, 
need to continue monitoring
