ISSUES
in wifi.c : 
	ssid and password are still hardcoded, 
	havent been able to find out why i cant use WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD
	printf returns <YOUR SSID> <YOUR PASSWORD>, 
	printf in the lab code file i was able to get the exact values

WARNINGS
	CYW43_LWIP redefined in wheel_encoder.c, motor_controller.c not sure why only those 2 
	files as well, as there should be multiple files calling for the same LWIP file, 
	need to continue monitoring 

	
ultrasonic task is suddenly not working, trapped in the while loop in getPulse(), was working before, callback doesnt seem to be called also
